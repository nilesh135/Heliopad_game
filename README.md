A computer graphics project showing the animation of 2-D helicopter game made using openGL library.In this project we are going to design a Helicopter game using OpenGL.This project displays a helicopter in flight with its fan and rotor stabilizer moving.The basic idea of the game is to dodge the rectangles and the game ends when the helicopter touches one of the rectangles.The score is calculated based on the distance covered by the helicopter before the crash.In this project we are going to design a Helicopter game using OpenGL.This project
